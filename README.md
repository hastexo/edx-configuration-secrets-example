# edx-configuration-secrets-example

This repository contains sensitive variables and files specific to an edx
deployment.

The configuration is just an example, and should not be used.  When a
new deployment is made, a branch should be created for that purpose,
and the playbook should be run with appropriate environment or group
vars pointing it to the location of this repository on the filesystem
of the deployment node.
